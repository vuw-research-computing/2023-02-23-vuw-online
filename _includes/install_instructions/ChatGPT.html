<h4>Using ChatGPT during the lessons.</h4>

<p>
  As you work through your programming exercises, ChatGPT can help you by answering any questions you may have about programming concepts, syntax, best practices, and more. Think of ChatGPT as your programming tutor, available at any time to help you learn and succeed.
</p>
</p>
  To use ChatGPT during your software carpentry lesson, simply open up a chat window with the program and ask your questions! ChatGPT can provide immediate answers, resources for further reading, and even code examples to help you better understand programming concepts.

  It's important to keep in mind that while ChatGPT is designed to be a helpful resource, it does have its limitations. As a language model, ChatGPT generates responses based on patterns it has identified in the text it has been trained on, and sometimes these responses may not be accurate or relevant to your question. Additionally, ChatGPT may occasionally generate responses that are completely unrelated or nonsensical. So while ChatGPT can be a useful tool, it's always a good idea to verify its responses and seek additional resources or support as needed.
